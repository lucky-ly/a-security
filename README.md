Here's my first experience with React. What I managed to create in about a month, started without any knowledge of React.

This project was started as some sort of a test task.
A friend of mine, [Vyacheslav Maletskiy](https://vk.com/maletskiy_design), created a design of the website for one of his contractors and proposed me as a full-stack developer.
They found someone else, which is unfortunate, but understandable.
But the important point is - no one is allowed to use the design partially implemented here - it's copyrighted.
